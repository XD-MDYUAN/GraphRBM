# GraphRBM
The Matlab implementation of 'Graph regularized Restricted Boltzmann Machine' (GraphRBM, IEEE TNNLS'18)

(1) A pre-defined graph matrix 'phi' (n x n) is required for all the experiments/datasets.

(2) run 'mian.m' to start a simple example.

(3) run 'train_GraphRBM_bin_bin.m' to train a GraphRBM (binary to binary).
